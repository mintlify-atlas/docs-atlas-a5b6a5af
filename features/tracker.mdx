## Tracking Insights

Click **"Check Insights"** to expand the analytics panel:

### Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Total Tracked" icon="bookmark">
    Number of internships/opportunities you've saved
    
    **Formula**: Count of all items in current tab
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Success Rate" icon="trophy">
    Percentage of applications that resulted in selection
    
    **Formula**: (Selected ÷ Total Applications) × 100
    
    **Example**: 3 selected out of 10 applied = 30% success rate
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Action Rate" icon="zap">
    Percentage of saved items you've actually applied to
    
    **Formula**: (Applied + Shortlisted + Selected + Rejected) ÷ Total Tracked × 100
    
    **Example**: 8 applied out of 12 saved = 67% action rate
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Success Rate** only considers items with status "Applied" or beyond (excludes "Not Applied" and "Draft").
</Info>

### Mobile Insights View

On mobile, insights are consolidated into a single card showing:
- **Top row**: Total Tracked and Success Rate side-by-side
- **Bottom section**: Action Rate in a highlighted box

### Interpreting Your Metrics

| Metric | Low | Good | Excellent |
|--------|-----|------|----------|
| **Success Rate** | < 10% | 10-25% | > 25% |
| **Action Rate** | < 50% | 50-75% | > 75% |

**Low Success Rate?** Consider:
- Using FTB Hustle's Resume and Interview Prep toolkits
- Applying to more positions that match your skills
- Seeking feedback on your applications

**Low Action Rate?** You're saving too many opportunities without applying. Focus on quality over quantity.

## Deadline Management

### Priority Indicators

Deadlines are color-coded:

- **Red/Amber Border**: Deadline within 7 days (high priority)
- **Normal**: Deadline more than 7 days away
- **Gray**: No deadline set or deadline passed

### Sorting

The tracker automatically sorts items by deadline:
1. **Earliest deadlines first** (most urgent at the top)
2. Items with no deadline appear at the bottom

<Warning>
  Items with approaching deadlines are pinned to the top. Review these daily to avoid missing opportunities!
</Warning>

### Integration with Calendar

Your tracked items automatically appear in:

- **Calendar Widget** (on Opportunities and Internships pages)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my tracker data private?">
    Yes! Your tracker is only visible to you. Other users cannot see what you've bookmarked or your application statuses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I access my tracker from multiple devices?">
    Absolutely. Your tracker syncs across all devices where you're logged in. Updates on one device instantly appear on others.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete an item by mistake?">
    Currently, deletions are permanent. We recommend bookmarking the internship/opportunity again from the main feed. An "undo" feature is planned for future releases.

  <Accordion title="Why is my success rate 0% even though I got selected?">
    Ensure the status is set to "Selected" (not "Shortlisted"). Also, success rate only calculates from items with status "Applied" or beyond - if you haven't marked any as "Applied", the rate will be 0%.
  </Accordion>
