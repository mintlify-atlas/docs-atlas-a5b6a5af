    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Complete Onboarding

After creating your account, you'll land on the onboarding page at `/onboarding`. This takes about 60 seconds and helps us personalize your feed.

  alt="Onboarding Flow"

### Quest 1: Pick Your Path

Choose your role on the platform:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Student" icon="user">
    You're here to find opportunities and get unstuck. The platform is optimized for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Society Member" icon="users">
    You share opportunities and run events for students. You can still browse everything.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// The role you select shapes your entire experience
type Role = "student" | "society";

const handleRoleSelect = (role: Role) => {
  setAnswers(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    role,
    // Society path keeps it light - no required education fields
    educationLevel: role === "student" ? prev.educationLevel : "",
    fieldOfStudy: role === "student" ? prev.fieldOfStudy : ""
  }));
};
```

<Note>
  **Everything is optional except your role.** You can skip any field and update your profile later.
</Note>

### Quest 2: Quick Basics (Optional)

Provide optional information to tune your feed:

- **Location:** State or city (helps show nearby events)
- **Education Level:** High School, Undergraduate, Postgraduate, PhD, or Other
- **Field of Study:** Engineering, Business, Design, Data Science, or Other

```typescript
// Location helps surface local opportunities
const answers = {
  state: "Maharashtra",  // Optional: state selection
  city: "Pune",          // Optional: or specific city
  educationLevel: "Undergraduate",
  fieldOfStudy: "Computer Science"
};
```

### Quest 3: What Should We Prioritize?

Select opportunity types you're interested in:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Opportunity Interests">
    Choose what you want right now:
    - Internships
    - Hackathons
    - Scholarships
    - Competitions
    - Grants
    - Fellowships
    - Conferences
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Domain Preferences">
    Pick topics you like:
    - AI/ML
    - Web Development
    - Mobile Development
    - Product Management
    - UI/UX Design
    - Data Science
    - Blockchain
    - Game Development
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

```typescript
// Multi-select - pick as many as you want
const interests = {
  opportunities: ["Internships", "Hackathons", "Scholarships"],
  domains: ["AI/ML", "Web Development", "Product Management"]
};
```

### Quest 4: You're Set

Review your selections and click **Start** to complete onboarding.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your profile summary">
    Check the live preview on the right side showing all your selections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Start'">
    Your preferences are saved automatically to your profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirected to /opportunities">
    You'll land on your personalized opportunity feed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```typescript
// Your profile is saved on completion
await saveProfile.mutateAsync({
  persona: answers.role,
  locationType: answers.state ? "state" : "city",
  locationValue: answers.state || answers.city,
  educationLevel: answers.educationLevel,
  fieldOfStudy: answers.fieldOfStudy,
  opportunityInterests: answers.opportunities,
  domainPreferences: answers.domains
});

// Then redirect to opportunities
router.push("/opportunities");
```

## Step 3: Discover Opportunities

You're now on the opportunities page at `/opportunities`. This is your personalized feed.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/opportunities.png"
  alt="Opportunities Feed"
/>

### Explore the Feed

The feed shows opportunities tailored to your profile:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Filter by Type">
    Click the filter dropdown to show specific types:
    - All Opportunities
    - Hackathons
    - Internships
    - Scholarships
    - Grants
    - Competitions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Filter by Tags">
    Click tags to filter by domains:
    - Engineering
    - Design
    - Product
    - AI/ML
    - Web Dev
    - And more...
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sort by Date">
    Sort opportunities by:
    - Newest first (default)
    - Ending soon (by deadline)
    - Most upvoted
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Understanding Opportunity Cards

Each opportunity card shows:
- **Image Gallery:** Visual preview (swipe for more)
- **Title & Organization:** Who's hosting the opportunity
- **Type Badge:** Hackathon, Internship, Scholarship, etc.
- **Description:** What it's about and why it matters
- **Tags:** Related domains and topics
- **Dates:** Start date and deadline
- **Location:** Where it's happening (online/offline)
- **Actions:** Bookmark, upvote, comment, share

## Step 4: Bookmark Your First Opportunity

Found something interesting? Let's bookmark it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an opportunity you like">
    Scroll through your feed and click on an opportunity card to expand details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the bookmark icon">
    Look for the bookmark icon in the actions bar at the bottom of the card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm it's bookmarked">
    You'll see a success toast: "Added to bookmarks" and the icon will fill in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your tracker">
    Navigate to `/tracker` to see all your bookmarked opportunities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Bookmarking Works

```typescript
// Clicking bookmark adds to tracker
const handleBookmarkChange = async (id: string, newState: boolean) => {
  if (!session?.user?.id) {
    toast.error("Please log in to bookmark opportunities");
    return;
  }

  if (newState) {
    // Add to tracker
    addToTracker({
      id,
      opportunityId: id,
      title: opportunity.title,
      company: opportunity.organiserInfo,
      type: opportunity.type,
      deadline: opportunity.endDate,
      kind: "opportunity"
    }, "Not Applied", "opportunity");
  } else {
    // Remove from tracker
    removeFromTracker(id);
  }

  toast.success(
    newState ? "Added to bookmarks" : "Removed from bookmarks"
  );
};
```

<Note>
  Bookmarks are stored in the database and synced across devices. You can access them from anywhere.
</Note>

## Step 5: Use the Application Tracker

Navigate to `/tracker` to manage your bookmarked opportunities.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/tracker.png"
  alt="Application Tracker"
/>

### Tracker Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Status Management" icon="list-check">
    Update application status: Not Applied, Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notes & Reminders" icon="note-sticky">
    Add custom notes for each opportunity. Set reminders for deadlines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calendar Sync" icon="calendar">
    View all deadlines in calendar view. Never miss an important date.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Details Modal" icon="window-maximize">
    Click any opportunity to view full details, add notes, and update status.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Updating Application Status

```typescript
// Track your progress through the application process
type ApplicationStatus = 
  | "Not Applied"
  | "Applied" 
  | "Interview"
  | "Offer"
  | "Rejected";

// Update status from the tracker
const updateStatus = async (id: string, status: ApplicationStatus) => {
  await fetch(`/api/tracker/${id}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    body: JSON.stringify({ status })
  });
};
```
