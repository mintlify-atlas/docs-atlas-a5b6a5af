## What is the Admin Panel?

The Admin Panel is a powerful dashboard that allows administrators to manage all aspects of the FTB Hustle platform. It provides centralized control over user management, content moderation, toolkit catalog, coupons, and broadcast posts.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

The admin panel is only accessible to users with the **admin** role.

### Access Requirements

- Must be logged in with a verified account
- User role must be set to `admin` in the database
- Available at `/admin` route

<Note>
Only users with the `admin` role can access the admin panel. Attempting to access this page with `user` or `member` roles will redirect to the homepage.
