## Prerequisites

Before creating an opportunity, ensure you:

- Have an active FTB Hustle account

    Navigate to the opportunities section and click the "Create Opportunity" or "New Post" button to open the submission form.

**Form validation errors**
- Read the error message carefully - it indicates which field needs correction
- Ensure title is between 4-100 characters
- Confirm description is between 10-2000 characters
- Add at least one tag

**Can't edit or delete**
