Stay organized with FTB Hustle's powerful bookmarking and task management tools. Save opportunities for later, track your applications, and never miss a deadline.

## Bookmarking Opportunities

Bookmarks allow you to save opportunities you're interested in for quick access later. When you bookmark an opportunity, it's automatically added to your tracker.

### How to Bookmark

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an opportunity">
    Browse opportunities in the feed or search for specific ones.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the bookmark icon">
    On any opportunity card, click the bookmark icon (🔖) in the action bar at the bottom.

    - Empty bookmark: Not saved
    - Filled yellow bookmark: Saved to your collection
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access bookmarked opportunities">
    View all your bookmarked opportunities in:
    - Your profile's bookmarks section
    - The opportunity tracker dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You must be logged in to bookmark opportunities. Bookmarking automatically adds the opportunity to your tracker with "Not Applied" status.
</Note>

### Bookmark Features

**Automatic Tracking**
When you bookmark an opportunity, it's added to your tracker with:
- Opportunity title and type
- Organization/organizer name
- Cover image (if available)
- Location information
- Deadline (end date)
- Default status: "Not Applied"

**Quick Actions**
- Click the bookmark icon again to remove the bookmark
- Removing a bookmark doesn't remove it from your tracker (you can manage tracker items independently)

<Tip>
  Bookmark opportunities as soon as you find them interesting, even if you're not ready to apply yet. This prevents losing track of good opportunities.
</Tip>

The task widget helps you create, organize, and complete tasks related to your opportunities and applications.

## The Opportunity Tracker

The tracker combines bookmarking and task management into a comprehensive application tracking system.

## Interaction Features

Beyond bookmarking, opportunities support several engagement features:

### Upvoting

- Click the heart icon (❤️) to upvote opportunities you like
- Upvotes help surface quality opportunities to other users
- Click again to remove your upvote
- Orange heart indicates you've upvoted

### Commenting

- Click the comment icon (💬) to view and add comments

## Database Schema

For technical understanding, here's how bookmarks and tasks are stored:

### Bookmarks Table
```sql
bookmarks {
  id: uuid (primary key)
  userId: text (references user)
  opportunityId: uuid (references opportunity)
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Unique combination of userId and opportunityId (one bookmark per opportunity per user)
- Cascade delete when user or opportunity is deleted

### Tasks Table
```sql
tasks {
  id: uuid (primary key)
  title: text (required)
  description: text (optional)
  opportunityLink: text (optional)
  completed: boolean (default: false)
  userId: text (references user)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```
